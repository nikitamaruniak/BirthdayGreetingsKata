# BirthdayGreetingsKata

This is an educational project for practicing TDD while solving the next problem.

## Write a program that:
1. Loads a set of employee records from a flat file.
2. Sends a greetings email to all employees whose birthday is today.

The flat file is a sequence of records, separated by newlines:
```
last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
```
The greetings email contains the following text:
```
Subject: Happy birthday!

Happy birthday, dear John!
```
